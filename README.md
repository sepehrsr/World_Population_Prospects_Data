# World_Population_Prospects_Data
Visualizing the World_Population_Prospects dataset and running a machine learning model to predict Life Expectancy at Birth

There are three folders:

Cleaning: I added six new features to the main dataset in order to better learn the machine learning model. The Python codes for cleaning these data are included in this section.

Visualizing: With the help of Power BI, some data visualizations were created

Machine_Learning: In order to predict Life Expectancy at Birth, some features were considered and a machine learning model was run
